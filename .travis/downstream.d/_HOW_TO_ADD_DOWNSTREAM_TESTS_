In order to add downstream tests to be run in CI, first add a test handler for
the downstream consumer that you want to test. This should be a file in this
".travis/downstream.d/" directory and follow the form defined in the
"downstream-template.sh" template file. The new test handler file should be
named in the format of {downstream name}.sh where {downstream name} is the
name that you wish to use to identify the consumer. Next, add an entry to
the test matrix in ".travis.yml" that sets the DOWNSTREAM environment
variable to the downstream name that you selected.
